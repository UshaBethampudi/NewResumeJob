# Deployment Fix for Mongoose ConnectionState Error

## Problem
The error `Cannot find module './connectionstate'` occurs when deploying to Render due to mongoose version compatibility issues.

## Solution Applied
1. **Downgraded mongoose to version 6.12.0** - This is a stable version that doesn't have the connectionstate module issue
2. **Removed conflicting mongoose dependency** from root package.json
3. **Ensured consistent dependency management**

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Clean Install Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Install fresh dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
# Start the server locally to test
npm start
```

### 3. Deploy to Render
The deployment should now work without the connectionstate error.

## Alternative Solutions (if the above doesn't work)

### Option 1: Use mongoose 5.x (most stable)
```json
"mongoose": "^5.13.15"
```

### Option 2: Add explicit connectionstate require
Add this to your server.js or db.js:
```javascript
// Add this line after mongoose import
require('mongoose/lib/connectionstate');
```

### Option 3: Use different deployment platform
Consider using Vercel, Railway, or Heroku which might handle mongoose dependencies better.

## Verification
After deployment, check that:
1. Server starts without errors
2. Database connection works
3. API endpoints respond correctly
